# PsychologistSimulation
Application simulating psychologists' appointments. The application creates multiple "psychologists" some of which accept clients individually and some do sessions with a group of clients. This application shows the flow of clients and psychologists. There is a fixed chance of a client "getting sick" and needing psychologists assistance. The client keeps coming back to the psychologist until he/she gets better. Also the application, depending on the amount of clients, determines how many psychologists need to be hired and fired in realtime. This application was written with C++ lanugage.
